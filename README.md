# YemeniHtml
This website was fully developed using simple HTML and CSS.

Hey, it's Nasr Al_aghbari

YemeniHtml was simply developed for practicing CSS and HTML as a beginner. This website has some useful pieces of information that you may be interested in, and
has many SVG examples that may be liked by you. You better not insert any important data in this website's forms because methods of these forms are set
to 'GET', so the data you inserted will appear in the Url of the page you are in. Thanks for visiting...
